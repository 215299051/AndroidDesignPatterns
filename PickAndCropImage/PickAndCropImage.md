		This demo app show, how we can add image chooser with material UI
		Image chooser will include all gallery and camera apps.
		
		Best part is that we can also crop selected image using this demo code.
		
		To crop image I have used "Android-Image-Cropper" by "ArthurHub" library.
		* Library github link - "https://github.com/ArthurHub/Android-Image-Cropper"
		
		//Step 1. Add Gradle dependency to app-gradle.
        //Step 2. Add CropImageActivity to app-manifest
        //Step 3. Add ImageUtilityHelper class in your project.
        //Step 4. Create object of ImageUtilityHelper class.
